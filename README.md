# Master Thesis - ROS-based visual servoing of a UR10 manipulation robot
This is the work space of my master thesis where you can find the different packages used to fulfill all the objectives and be able to perform visual servoing in simulation and with the UR10 robot.
The visual controllers implemented are position-based, image-based with Cartesian coordinates, image-based with cylindrical coordinates and hybrid (2-1/2 D hybrid visual controller).
